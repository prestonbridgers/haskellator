# Haskellator

Calculator written in Haskell with the Brick TUI library.
The vision of Haskellator is a quick-to-use terminal calculator supporting scientific functions and saveable variables.
I really like applications with a very minimalistic user interface that's intuitive to use.

## FEATURES UNDER CONSTRUCTION

1. The TUI (Brick)
2. The Haskellator language (supporting arithmetic expressions and variable assignment)

# Contribute

Unfortunately, the project is closed to contributions at this time.
I plan on accepting contributions once the application has made it out of initial development.
